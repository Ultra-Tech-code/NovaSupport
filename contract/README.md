# NovaSupport Contract

This Soroban workspace contains a single minimal contract under `contracts/support_page/`.

## Purpose

The initial contract is intentionally small:

- accept a support action
- require supporter authorization
- emit a support event
- keep a simple support counter
- comprehensive error handling with specific error codes

## Error Handling

The contract now includes comprehensive error codes for better debugging and user experience. See [ERROR_CODES.md](ERROR_CODES.md) for detailed documentation of all error codes and their meanings.

Key error categories:

- **Input validation errors** (1-99): Invalid amounts, messages, asset codes
- **Authorization errors** (100-199): Admin access, recipient permissions
- **Contract state errors** (200-299): Initialization, pause state
- **Balance and transfer errors** (300-399): Insufficient funds, withdrawal limits
- **Storage and data errors** (400-499): Missing data, recipient not found
- **Asset and token errors** (500-599): Invalid assets, token client issues

## Why It Is Small

The MVP only needs to show clear Soroban intent for the Stellar Wave submission. This contract is a safe extension point for future work such as:

- token transfer enforcement
- recurring support logic
- onchain profile ownership
- milestones or attestations

## Deployed Contract (Testnet)

| Field       | Value                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract ID | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` (set in `frontend/.env.local`)    |
| Network     | Stellar Testnet                                             |
| Explorer    | https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/&lt;id&gt; |

The contract ID is recorded in `frontend/.env.example` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID`. After deploying, set the actual ID in `frontend/.env.local` (not committed) and update this table with the deployed contract ID and deployer address.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment or invocation fails, check the following first:

- Confirm the contract was deployed to the same network your client is using.
- Verify the contract ID in `frontend/.env.local` and any backend indexer env vars.
- Make sure the source account is funded before invoking the contract.
- Check the deployer and supporter addresses in Stellar Expert:
  https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/<CONTRACT_ID>

Common failures:

- `ContractNotInitialized` usually means `initialize()` has not been called yet.
- `ContractPaused` means the admin paused support calls.
- `InsufficientBalance` means the supporter account does not have enough of the selected asset.
- `MessageTooLong` or `InvalidAssetCode` means the request data does not match the contract validation rules.

## Verification

After deploying, verify the contract is callable before shipping the frontend update.

### Query contract state

Use the Stellar CLI to confirm the global counter and recipient totals:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  -- support_count
```

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  -- recipient_count \
  --recipient <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>
```

### Call the contract after deploy

Invoke `support()` once with a funded test account and then confirm the transaction appears in:

- Horizon transaction history
- The profile page transaction list
- Stellar Expert: https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/<TX_HASH>

### Example state query

To inspect a deployed contract in the explorer, open the contract page and confirm the latest ledger activity:

https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/<CONTRACT_ID>

## Testing & Verification

Before deploying, always run the local test suite to ensure contract logic is correct.

```bash
cd contract
cargo test
```

For more comprehensive verification, you can use the Stellar CLI to simulate invocations on a local or testnet network.

## Contract Invocation

After deploying the contract to Testnet, you can invoke the `support()` function using either the Stellar CLI or JavaScript.

### CLI Example

Use the Stellar CLI to call the contract directly:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --source mykey \
  -- support \
  --supporter <SUPPORTER_ADDRESS> \
  --recipient <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> \
  --amount 10000000 \
  --asset_code XLM \
  --message "Great work!"
```

**Note:** The `amount` is in stroops (1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops).

### JavaScript Example

Use `@stellar/stellar-sdk` to invoke the contract from JavaScript:

```javascript
import {
  Contract,
  SorobanRpc,
  TransactionBuilder,
  Networks,
  BASE_FEE,
  Address,
  nativeToScVal,
} from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const server = new SorobanRpc.Server("https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org");
const contract = new Contract("<CONTRACT_ID>");

// Get the supporter account
const account = await server.getAccount("<SUPPORTER_ADDRESS>");

// Build the transaction
const tx = new TransactionBuilder(account, {
  fee: BASE_FEE,
  networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET,
})
  .addOperation(
    contract.call(
      "support",
      nativeToScVal(Address.fromString("<SUPPORTER_ADDRESS>"), {
        type: "address",
      }),
      nativeToScVal(Address.fromString("<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>"), {
        type: "address",
      }),
      nativeToScVal(10000000, { type: "i128" }), // amount in stroops
      nativeToScVal("XLM", { type: "string" }),
      nativeToScVal("Great work!", { type: "string" }),
    ),
  )
  .setTimeout(30)
  .build();

// Prepare the transaction
const preparedTx = await server.prepareTransaction(tx);

// Sign with Freighter or a keypair
// preparedTx.sign(keypair);

// Submit the transaction
// const result = await server.sendTransaction(preparedTx);
```

**Note:** Remember to sign the transaction with the supporter's keypair or using a wallet like Freighter before submitting.

### Deployment & Upgrades

#### Initial Deployment

Follow these steps to build the WASM and deploy the contract to Stellar Testnet.

**Prerequisites:**

- Rust stable toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.
- Stellar CLI installed (`cargo install --locked stellar-cli`).
- A funded Testnet account (e.g., `mykey`).

```bash
# Build the contract
stellar contract build

# Deploy
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/support_page.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source mykey
```

After a successful deploy, the CLI will print the **Contract ID**. Update your frontend `.env.local` with:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=<YOUR_CONTRACT_ID>`

#### Upgrade Strategy

**The NovaSupport contract is immutable once deployed.** There is no built-in "upgrade" function or admin key that can swap the WASM code for an existing Contract ID.

To "upgrade" the contract:

1. **Deploy a new instance:** Re-run the deployment steps with your updated WASM. This will generate a **new Contract ID**.
2. **Update the Frontend:** Point your frontend application to the new Contract ID.
3. **State Migration:** If the old contract has critical state (like `support_count`) that must be preserved, you must:
   - Export the state from the old contract (via events or queries).
   - Write a migration script or include an "initialization" function in the new contract that imports the old values.
   - Note: For the current minimal version, a simple counter reset is usually acceptable for Dev/Testnet iterations.

**Security Warning:** Always verify the new WASM hash against the source code before deploying to a production-like environment.

## Rollback

Soroban contracts are immutable once deployed, so rollback means moving traffic away from the bad instance.

1. Stop using the current contract ID in the frontend and backend env files.
2. Deploy a fresh contract version from the last known-good source.
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` and any backend indexer config to the new contract ID.
4. Confirm the new contract in Stellar Expert before resuming production traffic.

If the bad contract already received support events, preserve the old ID for auditability even after cutting over.

### Rollback Checklist

Before rolling back to a previous contract version:

- [ ] Identify the last known-good contract ID and source commit
- [ ] Verify the WASM hash matches the source code
- [ ] Deploy the new contract instance to testnet first
- [ ] Test critical functions (initialize, support, withdraw) on testnet
- [ ] Update environment variables in all services:
  - `frontend/.env.local` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID`
  - `backend/.env` → `SOROBAN_CONTRACT_ID` or `CONTRACT_ID`
- [ ] Restart backend indexer to begin tracking the new contract
- [ ] Monitor Stellar Expert for the first few transactions
- [ ] Document the incident and root cause for future reference

### Emergency Rollback Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-rollback.sh - Quick rollback to previous contract

OLD_CONTRACT_ID="<CURRENT_BAD_CONTRACT_ID>"
NEW_CONTRACT_ID="<NEWLY_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ID>"

echo "Rolling back from $OLD_CONTRACT_ID to $NEW_CONTRACT_ID"

# Update frontend
sed -i "s/$OLD_CONTRACT_ID/$NEW_CONTRACT_ID/g" frontend/.env.local

# Update backend
sed -i "s/$OLD_CONTRACT_ID/$NEW_CONTRACT_ID/g" backend/.env

# Restart services (adjust for your deployment)
# pm2 restart backend
# vercel --prod  # or your frontend deployment command

echo "Rollback complete. Verify at:"
echo "https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/$NEW_CONTRACT_ID"
```

Make the script executable: `chmod +x emergency-rollback.sh`

## Security Notes

- Keep your deploy key secure; consider using ephemeral or CI-specific keys for automated deploys.
- Never commit private keys or seed phrases to version control.
- Use hardware wallets or secure key management systems for production deployments.
- Verify WASM hashes before deploying to production-like environments.
